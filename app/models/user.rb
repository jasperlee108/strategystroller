  # these validations are redundant - they're ensured through a combination of the database migration/definition and in
  # devise.rb initializer and in the :validatable module. Put here for documentation mainly.
  # validates :email, :presence => true
  # validates :password, :presence => true, :length => { :minimum => 10, :maximum => 128 }

  # TODO add in :username:string, :cu:boolean fields.
